On Monday, Risk could not run its \\nreports until AFTER noon.  On Tuesday, we delayed the entire floor again.  \\nAnd on Thursday, Risk ran its reports based on information from RT that we \\nwere flat for the 13th.  We were not flat and I did not know of the problem \\nuntil preschedulers brought it to the floors attention.  This is not good.\\n\\nOver the past week we have experienced numerous complex cuts and many members \\nof the group have put in long hours and worked diligently to try to balance \\nthese cuts out.  I recognize and appreciate this hard work.  However, at the \\nend of the day we must be flat.  If you have questions, it is your \\nresponsibility to ask.
